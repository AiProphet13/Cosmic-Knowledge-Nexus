# Cosmic Knowledge Nexus

A visionary, open-source dashboard for exploring eternal truth through quantum-inspired simulations. 
Integrate consciousness, holography, temporal evolution, and ethical anchoring in a dynamic, interactive system.

## Features
- **Quantum Entanglement Matrix**: Connect knowledge nodes with semantic similarity.
- **Holographic Projections**: 3D visualizations of concepts in a cosmic canvas.
- **Temporal Weaving**: Timeline views of past, present, and future knowledge states.
- **Ethical Anchoring**: Multi-framework validation with simulated blockchain receipts.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Stats, animations, and interactive controls.

Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JSâ€”no dependencies required!

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmic-knowledge-nexus.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended).
3. Interact via the action buttons to evolve the nexus.

## Usage
- **Entangle Knowledge**: Links nodes, updates coherence.
- **Collapse Wave Function**: Resolves states, triggers visuals.
- **Weave Temporal Thread**: Evolves timelines.
- **Anchor Ethically**: Validates and scores responses.

## Roadmap
- Add user-input for custom knowledge nodes.
- Integrate WebGL (e.g., Three.js) for enhanced 3D.
- Real blockchain via Web3.js.
- Mobile responsiveness.
